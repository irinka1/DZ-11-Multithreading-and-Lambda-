/*Write a program that reads the number of peopleCount and maxAmount from the console.
Then creates peopleCount streams. Every stream is a person, wants to enter the library.
The library has a limit of count of people who can simultaneously be in it - maxAmount.
Each thread should write to the console that it (the person) does.
came to the entrance to the library
waiting for the entrance to the library (occurs only if there is no place at the time of coming to the library)
entered the library
reads the book (the thread should do this action randomly the amount of time from 1 to 5 seconds)
left the library

The door can simultaneously pass 1 flow. Time of passage through the door of the flow = 0.5 seconds).
There are additional actions on the part of the thread that they should write to the console:
went to the door from the street
approached the door from the inside
passes through the door inside
passes through the door to the outside

walked through the door outside
